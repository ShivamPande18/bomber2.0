# About
Bomber 2.0 is a game set up in a war scene where you are the pilot of a deadly fighter plane equipped with lethal weapons of complete mass destruction.
Your captain has given you the responsibility of stopping enemy trucks, approaching your country. You have all the arms ready, you have all the weapons ready but there is a problem. You can't fire a missile on the ground. Consider it strange or foolish but that's an order.
So control your plane, destroy the truck, use your weapons but beware don't hit the ground.
Welcome to Bomber Inc., a casual rage game where timing is all that you need.
Full of explosion, full of enthusiasm Bomber Inc. awaits for you.
